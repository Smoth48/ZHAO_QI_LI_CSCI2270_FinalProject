CSCI 2270 Data Structure---- Final Project


--Project Summary:       
            Our project is a game based on Dungeon Game, and is the simple version of that. We used C++ programming to build the code by using class, struct, linked list, dynamic memory which learned during this semester.


--How to Run:       
            Firstly the program will require you enter the name of the user(player).
            And then follow the steps and sentences in the code.
            Next, you can choose to fight with the boss and the guard in the game, also by pressing the simple key.


--Dependencies:

--Open issues/ Bugs:
  1. During the game, you can go back to the hall and pick up the potion in the corridor as many times as you want to keep the you alive. We made that intentionally, since we do not want the user to end the game really soon.
  2. The image of the characters are used by the simple Print to show the output of the image. Hence the location of the characters in the game might be slightly weird since the mislocation.
